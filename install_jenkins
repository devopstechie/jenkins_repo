#Run the following command to install the OpenJDK 8 package:

sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

#The current version of Jenkins does not support Java 10 (and Java 11) yet. If you have multiple versions of Java installed on your machine make sure Java 8 is the default Java version.

#The next step is to enable the Jenkins repository. To do that, import the GPG key using the following curl command:

curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo

#And add the repository to your system with:

sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key

#Once the repository is enabled, install the latest stable version of Jenkins by typing:

sudo yum install jenkins

#After the installation process is completed, start the Jenkins service with:

sudo systemctl start jenkins

#To check whether it started successfully run:

systemctl status jenkins

#Finally enable the Jenkins service to start on system boot.

sudo systemctl enable jenkins


#check with ip:8080 to see the jenkins UI
